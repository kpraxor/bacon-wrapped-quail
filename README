Bacon-Wrapped Quail
by Kevin Parker

Ingredients
	6 quail
	6 strips Wright's bacon
	12 pieces San Marcos sliced jalapeno peppers
	12 pieces sliced water chestnuts
	12 toothpics
	12 1/2 oz squares Philadelphia Cream Cheese
	1 small bottle Wishbone Italian Dressing

Preparation
	Filet the quail, saving 2 breast pieces per bird.  Begin by cutting along the breastbone on each side, then cutting along the back of the breast meat to remove the rib cage, and finally cutting off of the shoulder tendon.
	Cut each bacon strip in half, making 2 shorter strips.
	Arrange each breast centered lengthwise on top of a bacon strip.
	Place a jalepeno slice, perpendicular to the breast and bacon strip, and fill with cream cheese square.
	Place a water chestnut slice on the cream cheese, then wrap first with the top of the bacon strip, then the bottom, and secure with a toothpick through the bundle, being sure to spear the water chestnut in the center, and also passing through the jalapeno, quail breast, and bottom piece of the bacon.
	Repeat for each quail breast.
	Place each bundle in a dish, cover with Italian dressing for marinade, and refrigerate overnight.

Cooking
	Grill each quail breast over medium-hot direct mesquite charcoal until bacon is crisp on all sides.  Don't worry if it looks a little charred, it is more delicious that way!

Enjoy!
